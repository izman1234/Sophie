I can imagine using it for object detection, mapping, or even tracking changes in the environment. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to explore what I can do with it."

It's a different beast compared to coding. You might consider looking into existing robot kits or platforms that can give you a head start."

Being able to sync across devices would be really useful."
